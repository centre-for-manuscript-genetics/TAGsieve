============================================

A. REQUIREMENTS
	Install Python on your computer.
	Install pip.
	Install BeautifulSoup via pip:
		$ pip install beautifulsoup4

		$ sudo apt-get install pyqt4

	The program can then be called by opening TAGsieve/ and executing TAGsieve.pyw or via terminal

B. USE
	TAGsieve strips tags from .html, .htm, or .xml files, ignoring specified tags and attributes via whitelists.
	The desired files can be specified based on their extension, checking 'Clean HTML' will only clean .html/.htm files and 'Clean XML' does the according job.	
	It is possible to clean both a single file and a complete directory of files, based on the path information.

	Both tag and attribute whitelist should be entered according to a couple of rules.
	The tag whitelist must be a comma-separated list:
		x₁,..., xₙ
	The attribute whitelist must be entered according to the following pattern:
		x₁:[a₁,..., aₙ,]/.../xₙ:[a₁,..., aₙ,] for each tag x₁-xₙ and attributes a₁-aₙ.
